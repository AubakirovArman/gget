`gget` currently consists of the following modules:
- [`gget ref`](#gget-ref-)  
Fetch File Transfer Protocols (FTPs) and metadata for reference genomes and annotations from [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/) by species.
- [`gget search`](#gget-search-)   
Fetch genes and transcripts from [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/) using free-form search terms.
- [`gget info`](#gget-info-)  
Fetch extensive gene and transcript metadata from [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/), [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/), and [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) using Ensembl IDs.  
- [`gget seq`](#gget-seq-)  
Fetch nucleotide or amino acid sequences of genes or transcripts from [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/) or [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/), respectively.  
- [`gget blast`](#gget-blast-)  
BLAST a nucleotide or amino acid sequence to any [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) database.
- [`gget blat`](#gget-blat-)  
Find the genomic location of a nucleotide or amino acid sequence using [BLAT](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat).
- [`gget muscle`](#gget-muscle-)  
Align multiple nucleotide or amino acid sequences to each other using [Muscle5](https://www.drive5.com/muscle/).
- [`gget enrichr`](#gget-enrichr-)  
Perform an enrichment analysis on a list of genes using [Enrichr](https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/).
- [`gget archs4`](#gget-archs4-)  
Find the most correlated genes to a gene of interest or find the gene's tissue expression atlas using [ARCHS4](https://maayanlab.cloud/archs4/).
- [`gget pdb`](#gget-pdb-)  
Get the structure and metadata of a protein from the [RCSB Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/). 
- [`gget alphafold`](#gget-alphafold-)  
Predict the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence using a simplified version of [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/)â€™s [AlphaFold2](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold).
