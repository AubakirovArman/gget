                "The N-end rule pathway regulates protein stability by targeting proteins for ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. Polyubiquitylation of N-end rule substrates depends on their recognition by N-recognins, specific E3 ubiquitin ligases that use their conserved UBR-box and N-box domains to bind specific N-terminal protein motifs, called N-degrons, in their target proteins. N-degrons are defined by a destabilizing N-terminal residue. Type I destabilizing residues can either occur as primary destabilizing residues, which are positively charged amino acids directly recognized by N-recognins, or as secondary and tertiary destabilizing amino acids, which can be conjugated to a primary destabilizing residue. N-degrons containing type I destabilizing residues are specifically bound by the UBR-box of N-recognins. In contrast, type II destabilizing residues, which comprise bulky hydrophobic amino acids, initiate protein degradation by binding to the N-box of N-recognins.",
                "This class of N-degrons is defined by a positively charged type I primary destabilizing Arg or Lys residue in the N-terminal position, which is recognized by the UBR-box of N-recognins. Functional N-degrons of this class are generated from pre-N-degrons either by excision of the N-terminal Met on nascent proteins or by internal cleavage of a protein (Varshavsky,2011; Tasaki,2007). However, known Met-aminopeptidases catalyzing the N-terminal Met excision were so far found to cleave N-terminal of small amino acids (Varshavsky,2011), and the Arg- or Lys-containing N-degrons identified to date are generated by internal cleavage. It is important to note that the ELM prediction tool will only return internal N-degrons if the sequence of the cleavage product is entered for analysis.Once the active N-degron is generated, the N-terminal Arg or Lys residue binds to the UBR-box of N-recognins. The UBR-box is a highly conserved region whose tertiary structure is stabilized by two zinc fingers, which form a negatively charged binding pocket that rigidly binds the positively charged N-terminal amino acid. It was shown that Arg is favored over Lys as N-terminal residue. Binding also involves a shallow hydrophobic binding pocket that interacts with the side chain of the second residue of the motif. Despite a preference for hydrophobic residues in this second position, any amino acid except Pro is allowed. In addition, the UBR-box forms hydrogen bonds with the free alpha amino group and the backbone of the first three residues (Choi,2010; Tasaki,2012). Hence, the first two residues are the main determinants for specific binding to the UBR-box (3NIH; 3NII; 3NIJ; 3NIM). Recent studies showed binding of N-terminal His-containing N-degrons to the UBR-box, indicating a possible role for His as a primary type I destabilizing residue. However, compared to other primary type I interactions, this binding is very weak and naturally occurring N-degrons containing His have not yet been identified (Choi,2010).",

Asp- or Glu-containing pre-N-degrons can be generated by internal cleavage of a protein. Generation by Met excision has not been investigated yet as the known N-terminal Met-aminopeptidases that catalyze Met excision show no activity towards larger amino acids like Glu or Asp (Varshavsky,2011). It is important to note that the ELM prediction tool will only return internal N-degrons if the sequence of the cleavage product is entered for analysis.Once the secondary destabilizing Asp or Glu residue is exposed at the N-terminus of the protein, it is targeted by ATE1-encoded arginyl transferases (R-transferases) that transfer Arg from an Arg-t-RNA to the N-terminal amino group of the pre-N-degron. This N-terminal arginylation of the protein results in generation of a functional N-degron (Balzi,1990; Sriram,2011). In Mammals, six isoforms of R-transferase have been detected, differing in cellular location, tissue distribution and activity (Tasaki,2007). Their specificity depends on the N-terminal acidic residue in the substrate and is not affected by adjacent amino acids (Rai,2005; Hu,2005). The active N-degron generated after arginylation specifically binds to the UBR-box of N-recognins, initiating the degradation of the protein. The UBR-box is a highly conserved region whose tertiary structure is stabilized by two zinc fingers, which form a negatively charged binding pocket that rigidly binds the positively charged N-terminal amino acid.

Activity of these enzymes depends on their assembly in multi-protein histone modification complexes.

                "Non-covalent binding to SUMO proteins is mediated via the SUMO-interacting motif (SIM). SUMO-interacting proteins predominulltly function in the nucleus. The SIM is essential for a variety of cellular processes including transcriptional regulation, sub-nuclear localization, nuclear body assembly, and anti-viral response. Viral proteins are also known to utilize such processes via their SIMs upon host cell invasion.",
                "This SUMO interacting motif variant is for SIMs bound as a beta-augmented strand in the parallel orientation. The SIM peptide inserts into a groove on the SUMO surface so that the motif has a hydrophobic core of four residues (preference V, I or L), the 3rd position being more variable. At the variable 3rd position, in addition to hydrophobic residues, acidic residues (D or E) and the phosphorylatable residue serine are allowed. A stretch of 1 to 5 acidic or phosphorylatable residues is considered necessary C-terminally from the hydrophobic core. Another negative stretch N-terminal to the core appears more optional, though both are usually present. These acidic stretches complement positively-charged residues on the SUMO surface. The length of the acidic stretch may be involved in determining the orientation of binding. When the longer acidic stretch is C-terminal, the beta strand seems usually to be parallel. The two crystal structures of PIAS2 (2ASQ, Song,2005, O75928) and Daxx (2KQS, Chang,2011, O75928) support this theory: They both bind in parallel orientation and have a C-terminal acidic stretch. The crystal structure of RanBP2 (1Z5S, Reverter,2005, P49792) can be contrasted: It binds as an anti-parallel beta strand and has an N-terminal acidic patch. Because of the high similarity of the motif patterns for the parallel and antiparallel orientations, many SIMs will be detected by both of the motifs in ELM. Quite possibly, some SIM peptides may be able to bind to SUMO in both orientations.",

                "The motif peptide binds Arc in an unusual conformation as the middle strand of a 3-stranded β-sheet. The key structural determinullts in the N-lobe are the hydrophobic pocket and a groove formed by a β-strand. The peptides bind to the Arc N-lobe by β-augmentation. A long β-strand conformation of the peptide is required as a minimal peptide of PSY fails to bind (Zhang,2015). Mutational analysis identified two key resides: Pro in P2 and Tyr in P4 (Hallin,2021). Phe can also be accepted in the P4 position (4X3I; 6TNQ). It is likely that the Pro residue in P2 is essential to keep the peptide in an extended conformation, moreover, it stabilizes binding by interacting with the aromatic ring of Tyr227 deep in the hydrophobic groove. Other stabilizing amino acids are the above Tyr/Phe which also enters a hydrophobic pocket and makes additional C–H…π interactions with Phe220 and Phe271 in Arc (6TNQ; 6TNO). P2 with Arg instead of Pro was reportedly crystallised with Arc (4X3I) although a much lower binding affinity and is unlikely to be valid for the motif. In pull-down experiments, it was shown that Pro at P3 prevents binding (Zhang,2015) as expected due to disruption of the β-strand H bonding. A similar result was obtained by the phosphomimetic mutation of Ser in P3, which seems to either radically reduce the affinity or completely abolish the interaction. However, in other experiments, the same mutation on Ser did not affect the affinity of the binding (Hallin,2021).One of the Arc-interacting proteins (DLGP1) has a second binding motif with a Gly added in position after the Pro/Arg (6TQ0). The additional Gly residue might provide backbone flexibility that allows the alternate motif to bind with a β-bulge conformation. The requirement for backbone H bonds excludes Pro at P1, P3, and P5.Conflicting results have been obtained for His in the P+4 Tyr/Phe position (Nielsen,2019; Zhang,2015): currently, His is included in the motif but it appears to be weaker than  P+4 Tyr/Phe.",

The USP7-mediated deubiquitination of p53, MDM2 and USP7 inhibition by the herpes viral proteins EBNA1 and ICP0 shows its importance in the regulation of cell survival pathways and in controlling key cellular processes important for viral infection. The N-terminal MATH domain of USP7 is responsible for substrate recognition and nuclear localization while the catalytic core domain is required for the deubiquitinating activity. The C-terminal Ubl domain is responsible for several USP7 substrate interactions, including ICP0, GMPS, DNMT1 and UHRF1 leading to substrate stabilisation, USP7 translocation or activation",

The motif contains two basic lysine residues that recognise the acidic patch formed by buried aspartate residues on the Ubl2 domain of USP7. The motif identified in ICP0 and DNMT1 recognises the same domain in USP7, but the ICP0 interaction involves a backbone-to-backbone hydrogen bond (ICP0 nitrogen-C621 with USP7 oxygen-L760), which is not present in the DNMT1 interaction. Comparing sequence data with other C-terminal USP7 interaction partners does not make a higher discrimination of the motif possible, leading to its poor predictability. However a cooperative binding event involving the N-terminal binding motif to the MATH domain might be responsible for maintaining binding specificity.",

During autophagy, Atg8 proteins get directly conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipids to mediate membrane fusion events involved in autophagosome biogenesis such as phagophore formation and elongation. In addition, different Atg8 protein family members can recruit specific adaptors bound to ubiquitylated proteins, organelles or pathogens for degradation. Many of these adaptor proteins contain an LC3-interacting region (LIR) that mediates binding to Atg8 and Atg8-related proteins. These LIR:Atg8/LC3/GABARAP interactions are essential for cellular cell homeostasis as well as the control of intra- and extracellular stress conditions.",
                "The core of the LIR motif is defined by four amino acids and adopts a β-strand conformation that binds by β-augmentation, forming an intermolecular parallel β-sheet with the second β-strand of Atg8 protein family members (Rogov,2014). There is an absolute requirement for an aromatic residue at the N-terminal side of the LIR core and a large, hydrophobic residue at the C-terminal side. Structural studies have revealed that the side chain of the aromatic residue of the LIR motif binds deeply in HP1 whereas the hydrophobic residue docks to HP2 (2ZJD; Ichimura,2008). Position +2 in the core is solvent accessible and aromatic residues are not favoured. The presence of positive charges in the binding domain also restricts the +2 position to not-positively charged residues. The fixed distance from HP1 to HP2 makes it inadequate for a tiny residue or a Pro at +2 and +3 positions. The core motif is generally preceded by a varying number of acidic residues or by Ser or Thr residues that can be phosphorylated to incorporate a negative charge. These residues commonly occur within three positions N-terminal to the core motif. The negative charge of these acidic or phosphorylated residues has been shown to strengthen the LIR:Atg8/LC3/GABARAP interaction (Rogov,2013). Additional acidic residues or Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites that strengthen the interaction are sometimes observed in the positions between the aromatic (+1) and hydrophobic (+4) residue. A Trp residue is energetically favoured for this interaction over a Tyr or Phe residue, but the lower binding affinity can be compensated by electrostatic interactions between acidic residues or Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites of the LIR motif and basic residues in the N-terminal arm of the Atg8 homologues (Wild,2013). Analysis of current known structures indicates that the motif can be located at the C-terminus of the protein or be followed by a particular range of acidic or not residues immediately, or up to four positions, after the core.",

                "The autophagy-related protein Atg8 and its homologues LC3 and GABARAP play an important role in selective autophagy. During autophagy, Atg8 proteins get directly conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipids to mediate membrane fusion events involved in autophagosome biogenesis such as phagophore formation and elongation. In addition, different Atg8 protein family members can recruit specific adaptors bound to ubiquitylated proteins, organelles or pathogens for degradation. Many of these adaptor proteins contain an LC3-interacting region (LIR) that mediates binding to Atg8 and Atg8-related proteins. These LIR:Atg8/LC3/GABARAP interactions are essential for cellular cell homeostasis as well as the control of intra- and extracellular stress conditions.",
                "The core of the LIR motif is defined by four amino acids and adopts a β-strand conformation that binds by β-augmentation, forming an intermolecular parallel β-sheet with the second β-strand of Atg8 protein family members (Rogov,2014). There is an absolute requirement for an aromatic residue at the N-terminal side of the LIR core and a large, hydrophobic residue at the C-terminal side. Structural studies have revealed that the side chain of the aromatic residue of the LIR motif binds deeply in HP1 whereas the hydrophobic residue docks to HP2 (2ZJD; Ichimura,2008). Position +2 in the core is solvent accessible and aromatic residues are not favoured. The presence of positive charges in the binding domain also restricts the +2 position to not-positively charged residues. The fixed distance from HP1 to HP2 makes it inadequate for a tiny residue or a Pro at +2 and +3 positions. The core motif is generally preceded by a varying number of acidic residues or by Ser or Thr residues that can be phosphorylated to incorporate a negative charge. These residues commonly occur within three positions N-terminal to the core motif. The negative charge of these acidic or phosphorylated residues has been shown to strengthen the LIR:Atg8/LC3/GABARAP interaction (Rogov,2013). Additional acidic residues or Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites that strengthen the interaction are sometimes observed in the positions between the aromatic (+1) and hydrophobic (+4) residue. A Trp residue is energetically favoured for this interaction over a Tyr or Phe residue, but the lower binding affinity can be compensated by electrostatic interactions between acidic residues or Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites of the LIR motif and basic residues in the N-terminal arm of the Atg8 homologues (Wild,2013). Analysis of current known structures indicates that the motif can be located at the C-terminus of the protein or be followed by a particular range of acidic or not residues immediately, or up to four positions, after the core.",

                "The MAPK-docking motif, also known as D-motif or kinase interaction motif (KIM) consists of one or more basic and two to four hydrophobic residues in adjacent groups. These residues bind to the MAPK-docking groove in various MAPKs. The basic-hydrophobic pattern can be present either in N- to C-terminal or C- to N-Terminal orientation. A linker region of variable length intersects the basic and hydrophobic residues. This linker region may build secondary structures, like helices, and therefore can add some additional order to the motif bound state. The docking motif patterns vary according to which MAPKs are to be bound. Some docking motifs are quite specific while others are more general.The binding site of the D-motifs is distinct from another MAPK docking motif class (the FxFP-type), thus they can act in a combinatorial manner.",
                "The greater MEF2A class of MAPK docking motifs mediates interaction towards the ERK1/2 and p38 subfamily of MAP kinases. (Garai,2012, Zeke,2015). Known partners include the mammalian ERK1 (MAPK3), ERK2 (MAPK1), p38α (MAPK14) and p38β (MAPK11) proteins. They may also bind other classical MAPKs, including the mammalian ERK5 (MAPK7) (Barsyte-Lovejoy,2004). MEF2A-type motifs motifs are also found in fungi and higher plants, interacting with diverse MAPKs (Jung,2002; Hamel,2011). Since the CD region of ERK1/2 and p38 isoforms is wider compared to that of JNK, the N‐termini of motifs binding to these kinases have larger conformational freedom and can make different motif patterns.

                "The MAPK-docking motif, also known as D-motif or kinase interaction motif (KIM) consists of one or more basic and two to four hydrophobic residues in adjacent groups. These residues bind to the MAPK-docking groove in various MAPKs. The basic-hydrophobic pattern can be present either in N- to C-terminal or C- to N-Terminal orientation. A linker region of variable length intersects the basic and hydrophobic residues. This linker region may build secondary structures, like helices, and therefore can add some additional order to the motif bound state. The docking motif patterns vary according to which MAPKs are to be bound. Some docking motifs are quite specific while others are more general.The binding site of the D-motifs is distinct from another MAPK docking motif class (the FxFP-type), thus they can act in a combinatorial manner.",
                "The greater MEF2A class of MAPK docking motifs mediates interaction towards the ERK1/2 and p38 subfamily of MAP kinases. (Garai,2012, Zeke,2015). Known partners include the mammalian ERK1 (MAPK3), ERK2 (MAPK1), p38α (MAPK14) and p38β (MAPK11) proteins. They may also bind other classical MAPKs, including the mammalian ERK5 (MAPK7) (Barsyte-Lovejoy,2004). MEF2A-type motifs motifs are also found in fungi and higher plants, interacting with diverse MAPKs (Jung,2002; Hamel,2011). Since the CD region of ERK1/2 and p38 isoforms is wider compared to that of JNK, the N‐termini of motifs binding to these kinases have larger conformational freedom and can make different motif patterns.

The SIM is essential for a variety of cellular processes including transcriptional regulation, sub-nuclear localization, nuclear body assembly, and anti-viral response. Viral proteins are also known to utilize such processes via their SIMs upon host cell invasion.",
                "This SUMO interacting motif variant is for SIMs bound as a beta-augmented strand in the antiparallel orientation. The SIM peptide inserts into a groove on the SUMO surface so that the motif has a hydrophobic core of four residues (preference V, I or L), the 2nd position being more variable. At the variable 2nd position, in addition to hydrophobic residues, acidic residues (D or E) and the phosphorylatable residue serine are allowed. A short stretch of 1 to 5 acidic or phosphorylatable residues is considered necessary C-terminally from the hydrophobic core. Another negative stretch N-terminal to the core appears more optional, though both are usually present. These acidic stretches complement positively-charged residues on the SUMO surface. The length of the acidic stretch may be involved in determining the orientation of binding. When the longer acidic stretch is C-terminal, the beta strand seems usually to be parallel. The two crystal structures of PIAS2 (2ASQ, Song,2005, O75928) and Daxx (2KQS, Chang,2011, O75928) support this theory: They both bind in parallel orientation and have a C-terminal acidic stretch. The crystal structure of RanBP2 (1Z5S, Reverter,2005, P49792) can be contrasted: It binds as an anti-parallel beta strand and has an N-terminal acidic patch. Because of the high similarity of the motif patterns for the parallel and antiparallel orientations, many SIMs will be detected by both of the motifs in ELM. Quite possibly, some SIM peptides may be able to bind to SUMO in both orientations.",

The CDKs in complex with cyclins control progression through the cell cycle by specific phosphorylation of various substrates. Phosphorylation depends on motif-mediated binding of CDK to a phosphorylation site (MOD_CDK_1) and simultaneous binding of the CDK-bound cyclin to the cyclin-recognition site (DOC_CYCLIN_1) on the CDK substrate. These interactions are in many cases sufficient for protein phosphorylation by CDK. However, some substrates additionally interact with cyclin-CDK-associated Cks1, which increases the specificity and efficiency of substrate phosphorylation. This interaction is mediated by phospho-dependent Cks1-binding motifs in the CDK substrates, which allows docking of CDK substrates for phosphorylation and multi-phosphorylation. In addition, Cks1 might also recruit regulators of CDK activity.",
                "The phospho-dependent Cks1-binding motif is actived by priming phosphorylation of the core threonine residue (Koivomagi,2013). Its attached phosphate binds in a cationic pocket on Cks1 while its gamma-methyl group makes additional Van der Waals contacts with Y30 and R42 of Cks1 (4LPA) (McGrath,2013; Arvai,1995). A second conserved motif residue is the proline in the +1 position that specifically binds in a pocket formed by Y30 and T80 of Cks1. Furthermore, this proline is required for the priming phosphorylation of threonine by CDK, which is a proline-directed kinase (MOD_CDK_1). Binding of the motif is further enhanced by a conserved interaction of the L83- and R75-containing pocket on Cks1 with a hydrophobic residue in the -2 position. Peptide arrays showed that aromatic residues are favoured in this position, probably due to R75 making cation-pi contacts (McGrath,2013). These arrays also showed basic residues to be disfavoured in the +2 position. However, multiple sequence alignments using fungal sequences showed a wider preference in the -2 position and a tolerance for arginine in the +2 position. The current motif definition is based on yeast data, as not much experimental evidence is available for vertebrate sequences.Mutational studies showed that the Cks1-docking site is located N-terminally of the secondary phosphorylation site (Koivomagi,2013). In addition to this N-to-C directionality, the phosphorylation rate depends on the distance between the Cks1-docking motif and the target phosphorylation site. Distances less than 10 amino acids were shown to prevent phosphorylation, while distances over 32 amino acids also impaired phosphorylation. These results were confirmed in vivo, showing an optimal distance of 16-20 residues (Koivomagi,2013). This distance dependency indicates that phosphorylation requires simultaneous binding of CDK and Cks1 to the CDK substrate. Several CDK substrates contain multiple Cks1-binding motifs to promote multi-site phosphorylation.",

As the proline is the only residue to fit this pocket, it is strongly favoured at the P+1 position. Binding of any substrate that does not have a Pro at the P+1 position is unfavourable because of an unsatisfied hydrogen bond from the nitrogen atom in the main chain of the substrate (Zhu,2005). The basic residue at the P+3 position contacts the phosphothreonine in the activation loop of the CDK (2CCI).",

SH2 is the main binding domain for TK phosphorylation signalling events.",
                "The SH2 domain of the CRK  family (CRK-1, CRK-II splice isoforms and CRK-like) binds a phosphotyrosine motif with optimal specificity for Pro or Leu at the pY+3 position (Liu,2010; Huang,2008; 1JU5). The motif appears to be present in pre-metazoans as well as in metazoans (Shigeno-Nakazawa,2016). The SH2 domain topology consists of a central β sheet with three anti-parallel β strands and two α helices, one each side of the sheet (Donaldson,2002). The pY residue of the ligand interacts with two highly conserved basic residues (R15 and R33) in the phosphotyrosine binding pocket situated at one side of the anti-parallel β sheet. Pro at the pY+3 position is buried in a hydrophobic pocket that lies on the other side of the three anti-parallel beta sheets. This hydrophobic pocket is lined by residues Y60, I61, I89, and L109 from the EF and BG loops that make important non-polar contacts with the pY+3 residue. The intermediate residue positions are more tolerant, indicating they are less critical for the interaction. However; peptide library SPOT arrays reveal residue preferences at specific positions which significantly diminish or even prohibit binding (Liu,2010; Huang,2008). Arrays also show that Val or Ile are allowed at +3, though they are clearly weaker than Pro or Leu and may require optimal residues in the adjacent positions to reach a good affinity. Acidic residues are disfavored at multiple positions. Hydrophobic residues, particularly large ones, are disfavoured at several positions. Unusually for SH2, basic residues are tolerated in several positions, with His being less preferred. Pro is prohibited at the +1 position. As seen in some of the physiological ligands, an Arg residue is most favoured at the pY+4 position as it is positioned to contact Asp-91 in the CRK SH2 domain (1JU5) whereas acidic residues are non-permissive (Liu,2010; Huang,2008). The current pattern is predominulltly derived from the SPOT arrays for CRK and CRKL in (Huang,2008)",

Lys63-Ub chains are not signals for destruction, so this motif is not a degron. The process is central to the NF-κB gene activation pathways based on surface receptor signalling, such as via the RANK, TLR and CD40 receptors. This information-transmitting cellular process is used in developmental, immunological and inflammatory signalling. Some substrates have more than one TRAF6-binding motif, facilitating the cooperative assembly of large regulatory complexes.

In the structure of TifA peptide bound to TRAF6 (6A33), the +6 Glu makes a double salt-bridge to Arg466 of TRAF6 (Huang,2019). In the structure of CD40 peptide bound to TRAF6 (1LB5), the +6 Tyr stacks onto the guanidinium group of Arg392 (Ye,2002).

                "Progression through the cell cycle is driven by sequentially changing sets of substrates getting phosphorylated by Cdk(s) coupled to cyclin activators with distinct substrate specificities. In yeast, Cdc14 is a widely conserved, dimeric, cell-cycle regulated phosphatase that is a key regulator of mitotic exit events by dephosphorylating a subset of Cdk1 substrates. It is inhibited by Net1 during most of the cell cycle and gets only activated during mitotic exit, leading to its nuclear translocation and the sequential dephosphorylation of its targets. Although Cdc14 homologues show differences in the timing, targets and functional readout of their phosphatase activities, their target specificity for (S)PxK/r phosphosites is mostly conserved. Interestingly, docking of the non-catalytic, N-terminal domain of budding yeast Cdc14 to a PxL motif on substrates can facilitate the recognition and dephosphorylation even of substrates carrying suboptimal phosphosites, a mechanism yet to be validated in other organisms.",
                "The optimal Cdc14 target recognition consensus motif (S)P.[Kr] was derived from mutational analyses combined with in vitro phosphopeptide dephosphorylation assays (Bremmer,2012). The results suggested that phosphothreonines are very weak substrates of Cdc14, proline is absolutely required in the +2 position and that a positive residue is strongly favoured in the +4 position, with lysine being more favourable for efficient catalysis than arginine. Additional positive charges in the +3, +5 or +6 positions confer slight improvements in catalytic efficiency (Bremmer,2012), but they are not strictly required based on the experimentally validated instances. Although the human Cdc14 homologues, CDC14A and CDC14B and the fission yeast Clp1 showed similar residue preferences in peptide dephosphorylation assays, and the residues contributing to the active site are highly conserved (Bremmer,2012), phosphosites of their experimentally validated substrates suggest that they have a more relaxed recognition pattern, wherein the +4 position does not require a positively charged residue.The structure of the complex between a phosphatase-dead mutant of Cdc14 and an S-phosphorylated Swi6p peptide provides information on the catalytic mechanism of Cdc14 (5XW5). A structure of human CDC14B with a substrate peptide is also available, but unfortunately the peptide is too short to contain the positive residues in the positions following the (S)P (1OHE; Gray,2003). Phosphothreonines are poor Cdc14 substrates, mainly due to a steric clash with the methyl group of a conserved alanine residue contributing to the phosphatase active site (Bremmer,2012; Eissler,2014). Results of high-throughput phosphoproteomics studies (Eissler,2014; Powers,2017) and peptide docking simulations (Eissler,2014) also confirmed the (S)P.[Kr] motif.",

CRLs are activated by covalent attachment of NEDD8 to a conserved C-terminal lysine.

The CRL RING domain (RBX1 or RBX2) acts as ligase by binding the E2~NEDD8 intermediate and catalysing NEDD8 transfer. The NAE1-UBA3 is required to be able to recognise both E2s which is in partly mediated by a distinct binding of the E2s core domain to the E1 ubiquitin fold domain and partly by a E2 N-terminal binding motif which binds to a groove of UBA3 in the E1 complex.",

Depending on organism, cell type as well as the nature of the adaptin complex bound, they can target either to cell surface or to specific, internal membrane-bound organelles (endosomes, lysosomes, melanosomes, synaptic vesicles, etc.)All these motifs are believed to bind to the sigma subunit of activated adaptin complexes (AP-1, AP-2 and AP-3). These clathrin-associated complexes are ancient and found in most eukaryotes. Dileucine motifs are variable (especially at their negatively charged positions and at the hydrophobic residues) and the various motif subtypes tend to have slightly different functions (Mattera,2011).One should avoid confusing the adaptin sigma-binding classical dileucine motifs discussed here, and the GGA-binding lysosomal targeting motifs (sometimes also called dileucine motifs).",
                "The strict version of the dileucine motif is one of the most common variants, preferentially binding to AP-1 or AP-2 complexes. These motifs generally allow the proteins to reach the cell surface in multicellular animals, such as a basolateral localization in epithelia and/or reversible endocytosis into early endosomes. In neurons, such motifs are sometimes involved in somato-dendritic cell surface localization. The lack of a proline immediately preceding the two hydrophobic positions distinguishes these motifs from obligatory lysosomal (or axonal) targeting signals. Although historically called acidic dileucine motifs, one or both hydrophobic positions can also be exchanged for hydrophobic amino acids other than leucine. On the other hand, dileucine motifs are more restrictive at their N-terminal ends. Contrary to earlier suggestions (Kelly,2008), it has now become clearer that dileucine motifs strongly prefer glutamate versus aspartate at their first position (an observation also supported by evolutionary conservation analyses). Structurally, this is due to the distance between the motif main chain and the charged surface of the sigma subunit, with Asp being too short (4P6Z_V; 4NEE_E; 6DFF_L; 6OWT_N). Conversely, Asp-carrying motifs need additional strengthening features (such as the above-mentioned proline) to remain functional. These divergent instances are now also treated as a separate motif subtype in ELM. Addition of one or more extra glutamates before the first Glu can also act as a strengthening feature, although it is not required for functionality if the hydrophobic contact points are otherwise optimal.The classical motif variant apparently also exists in diverse eukaryotes, including fungi and plants. The latter dileucine motifs were implicated in membrane protein sorting to vacuoles or tonoplasts (Wang,2014). Thus, in these organisms, the motif appears to be functionally equivalent to other dileucine motif subtypes, including lysosomal targeting signals.",

                "Several phosphodegrons are required for cell state-dependent recognition of regulatory proteins by SCF complexes via repeat domains of associated F box proteins (FBPs) and their subsequent ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The SCF-FBW7 and the SCF-betaTrCP1 motifs, contain two phosphorylated residues, which are recognised via a WD40 domain. For example, the SCF-FBW7 degron TPxxS is found in cyclin E, which is required for the G1/S transition. The SCF-betaTrCP1 degron DSGxxS operates in a broader range of cell regulation. For example, NF-kappa-B inhibitors are phosphorylated and destroyed under immune stimulation while beta-catenin is degraded in the absence of Wnt signalling. Skp2, another FBP, recognises cell cycle regulators via its leucine-rich repeat. In case of the single-phosphorylated DEG_SCF_Skp2-Cks1_1 motif, Skp2 requires additional binding of Cks1 for recognition. So far, only a few cell cycle inhibitors, including p27Kip1 that is mainly involved in G1 arrest, have been found to carry this degron.",
                "FBW7 (also called FBXW7,  hCdc4 or hSel10) is a member of a family of F-box proteins that binds via WD40 beta propeller to its substrates after their phospho-degron motifs (also named CPDs, i.e. Cdc4 phospho-degrons) have been doubly phosphorylated (Hao,2007, Welcker,2008). The core of the motif is TPxxS, preceded by a variable number of hydrophobic residues. The motif is used in cell cycle regulation: the widely conserved G2 phase-specific cyclin E destruction by FBW7 was first described in yeast. The Thr is often phosphorylated by GSK3, after priming at the other P-site, linking the FBW7 activity with the mitogenic signalling pathway. In some instances the Thr may alternatively be targeted by other kinases such as CDKs. Interestingly, many of the known FBW7 substrates are proto-oncogenes with key roles in the regulation of cell division, differentiation and growth. However, a proposed FBW7 phosphodegron in the key cell state monitor mTor (Mao,2008) does not match the diphosphorylated motif. The phosphodegron in v-Jun is mutated and inactivated, enhancing oncogenicity by preventing its destruction. Some variant motifs substitute a Glu residue for the second phosphosite, e.g. in SV40 large T, and this variant is represented by the alternative pattern in ELM.",

The COPI vesicle coat consists of the coatomer and the small GTPase ADP ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1). The C-terminal μ Homology Domain (MHD) of the coatomer subunit δ-COP resides in the outermost layer of the coat, furthest from the vesicle membrane, thus being highly accessible to other factors. This MHD binds tryptophan-based motifs within the unstructured regions of coatomer assembly/tethering/disassembly factors, like the Dsl1 tether (yeasts) and the ArfGAPs (yeasts and mammals), that influence the life cycle of COPI-coated vesicles. Binding of such di-tryptophan motifs is unique to δ-COP MHD because the residues and the lengths of loops involved in binding are not conserved in other MHDs, like those of AP complexes, the TSET complex or muniscin family members FCHO1 and FCHO2.",
                "The δ-COP MHD binds with low micromolar KDs (∼10-40 μM) to di-tryptophan peptides with spacing of one to six residues embedded in negatively charged sequence. This suggests that the presence of two relatively closely spaced tryptophan side chains is the main determinullt for δ-COP MHD binding (Suckling,2015), augmented by electrostatic interactions between charged and polar residues. In the crystal structure (5FJZ), the WxW peptide from the Dsl1p lasso segment binds in an extended conformation with each tryptophan residue occupying a complementary hydrophobic pocket. Other motifs bound in a similar manner, including a WxxxW motif also from Dsl1p and the C-terminal WxxF motif of the yeast ArfGAP protein Gcs1p (5FJX; Suckling,2015). The binding site is comprised of δ-COP MHD strands 4 and 6 and the loop between strands 5 and 6. The identities of the residues and length of the interstrand loop at this site are well conserved from yeast to mammals. Importantly, di-Trp motif binding is unique to δ-COP because neither the residues nor the lengths of loops involved in binding are significantly conserved in other MHDs (Suckling,2015). Based on the verified instances and artificial peptides tested in mutational analyses (Cosson,1998; Rawet,2010; Suckling,2015) negatively charged residues are required in the vicinity of the specificity-determinullt tryptophans: However, they are always present preceding the first Trp and these are included in the motif pattern.The provided motif pattern may have a phylogenetic limitation: Based on mutation studies of the rat δ-COP - ArfGAP1 interaction (Rawet,2010), the tryptophan residues in ArfGAP1 could not be replaced by different aromatic or hydrophobic residues, whereas they can be for the δL peptide (C-terminal 17 residues of the YOR112Wp/Cex1p protein) in yeast (Cosson,1998).",

Depending on organism, cell type as well as the nature of the adaptin complex bound, they can target either to cell surface or to specific, internal membrane-bound organelles (endosomes, lysosomes, melanosomes, synaptic vesicles, etc.)All these motifs are believed to bind to the sigma subunit of activated adaptin complexes (AP-1, AP-2 and AP-3). These clathrin-associated complexes are ancient and found in most eukaryotes. Dileucine motifs are variable (especially at their negatively charged positions and at the hydrophobic residues) and the various motif subtypes tend to have slightly different functions (Mattera,2011).One should avoid confusing the adaptin sigma-binding classical dileucine motifs discussed here, and the GGA-binding lysosomal targeting motifs (sometimes also called dileucine motifs).",
                "Members of this unusual variant, also called monoleucine motifs, only contain one hydrophobic residue (Leu) at +5 instead of having two at +5 and +6 (Gephart,2011). In turn, the canonical glutamate at +1 is preceded by a second negatively charged glutamate at position -1. The monoleucine motifs are usually involved in basolateral sorting of membrane proteins in polarized epithelial cells in multicellular animals (by binding to AP-1).While no detailed structural information is available (as of 2021), the sequence conservation is rather compelling about the existence of this dileucine motif variant. The only preserved hydrophobic amino acid (that appears to be an invariable leucine in known examples) corresponds to the first hydrophobic position of more typical dileucine motifs. The second position (that is less buried in the structures of other dileucine motifs) is replaced by a non-hydrophobic amino acid, presumably weakening the motif interaction. It might only retain functionality because of the extra Glu (-1) preceding the canonical glutamate (+1). Glu -1 is suggested to make further electrostatic contacts to adaptin sigma subunits (most notably, sigma of the AP-1 complex). The difference of charge densities across adaptin complexes likely also plays a role in the relatively restricted biological function (almost always acting as a basolateral polarity signal) of these monoleucine motifs.Although existence of motif variants, where one of the double glutamates is replaced by an aspartate cannot be fully excluded, it is expected to be very rare. Therefore, Asp (-1 or +1) is not included in the current regular expression. On the other hand, a Pro is likely permitted at +4 without substantial alteration of function.While not yet described in eukaryotes other than multicellular animals, proteome-wide searches and conservation analyses suggest that monoleucine motifs likely also exist in many other eukaryotic organisms, including plants.",

N-terminus of Pex14 contains three alpha helices. Helices alpha1 and alpha2 are anti-parallel oriented whereas helix alpha3 is diagonal to helices alpha1 and alpha2. Interaction between Pex5 and Pex14 is stronger than between Pex19 and Pex14. Salt bridge stabilises Pex5-Pex14 complex (2W84) and it involves conserved LYS56 residue in Pex14. Corresponding salt bridge is not observed in the structure of Pex19-Pex14 complex (2W85). Lack of this salt bridge in Pex19 motif may contribute to the reduced binding affinity of Pex19 compared to Pex5 (Neufeld,2009). Pex5 adopts amphipathic alpha helical conformation when it binds diagonally across helices alpha1 and alpha2 of N-terminus Pex14. Pex19 also forms amphipathic alpha helix upon binding to the identical site in Pex14. However Pex19 binds to Pex14 in opposite orientation to Pex5 ligand. Upon binding of FxxxF motif of Pex19 or Wxxx[FY] motif of Pex5 to N-terminus of Pex14, positively charged helices alpha1 and alpha2 are flanked by negatively charged helix alpha3 on one side and by negatively charged Pex5 or Pex19 ligands on the other side.

The last three positions of the motif are variable, which indicates a consensus motif of '^M?[AS]...' . All proteins known to have a function in apoptosis regulation contain alanine residues in the first position of their IBM, except for caspases 3 and 7. At the moment the role of these serine IBMs in the caspase IAP interactions is not fully understood (Eckelman,2008; Riedl,2001; Scott,2005). Peptide library scans indicate that type II BIR domains do select for an N-terminal serine residue of an IBM, but the selection is insignificant compared to alanine in P1 (Eckelman,2008).

These three motifs bind to the same hydrophobic binding site in Pex14 (O75381) which is the minimal translocon that is essential for TRG_PTS1 cargo translocation into peroxisomal matrix. The N-terminal domain of Pex14 interacts with Wxxx[FY] and LVXEF[LM] motifs in Pex5 (Fungi: LIG_Pex14_4) to target PTS1-containing peroxisomal matrix enzymes entry into the peroxisomal matrix followed by interaction between cargo-free Pex5 with SH3 domain of Pex13 (Q92968) via Wxxx[FY] motif for recycling of Pex5 into the cytosol. Pex19 contains an FxxxF motif that mediates Pex19-Pex14 interactions. Pex19 is considered to be the cytosolic import receptor for peroxisomal membrane proteins that contain an mPTS motif.",
                "The Wxxx[FY] motif is present in the N-terminal half of soluble Pex5 protein across species including human, protozoa, yeast, arabidopsis and watermelon. Ninety percent of PEX5 proteins are present in the cytosol and ten percent in the lumen of peroxisome (Wimmer,1999). These motifs bind to Pex13 and Pex14 proteins located at the outer surface of peroxisomal and glycosomal membranes, interacting with either a SH3 domain (SM00326) of Pex13 or a conserved region within the N-terminus of Pex14 (PF04695). The first position after the tryptophan of the Wxxx[FY] motif can be any amino acid while the second and third positions have preference for hydrophilic amino acids. The third position is usually occupied by ASP, GLU or GLN (Schliebs,1999). Removal of either tryptophan at position 1 or phenylalanine/tyrosine at position 5 will result in loss of motif function. Mutations of residues at position 3 or 4 did not abolish interaction (Saidowsky,2001). Based on secondary structure predictions (Schliebs,1999) and crystal structure data (2W84, Neufeld,2009), this motif is part of an amphipathic alpha-helix. Upon binding to Pex14, Pex5 adopts an amphipathic α-helical conformation with a negatively charged surface in Pex5 binding to a positively charged Pex14 surface. It was suggested that charge complimentarity is one of the determinullts of Pex5-Pex14 interaction. The helices α1 and α2 of Pex14, to which Pex5 binds, are antiparallel whereas the α3 helix is diagonal across α1 and α2. A major determinullt of affinity is the requirement for the segment that contains the Wxxx[FY] motif to being able to form an α-helix, while a negatively charged amino acid at the ninth position from tryptophan reduces binding affinity (Neufeld,2009).",

The EVH1 domains have a conserved tryptophan residue in the motif-binding pocket that coordinates a proline residue in the binding partner. The human PPP4R3 EVH1 domain has two similar yet distinct consensi recognizing both FxxP- and MxPP-containing peptides. The binding mode of the PPP4R3 FxxP-like peptides matches the polyproline helix binding modes of EVH1 domains of  WASP, SPRED, Homer and Ena/VASP. No structure was available for the MxPP-containing peptides bound to the PPP4R3 EVH1 domain. The PPP4R3 EVH1 domain is found throughout eukaryotes and the FxxP-binding pocket is largely conserved which emphasizes the general mechanism of PP4 binding. However, few of the characterised instances are conserved over large evolutionary distances.",
                "The FxxP and MxPP docking motifs both bind the PP4 EVH1 domain with affinities in the low µM (1-10µM) range (Ueki,2019). Similar to the specificity determinullts of the FxxP motif, alanine scanning of the MxPP motif revealed that a hydrophobic residue in position 1, in this case methionine, and a proline in position 4 are required for binding. However, in order to accommodate methionine in position 1, position 3 and 4 must be proline. Phage display and ITC data showed that PP4 binding peptides have a preference for additional prolines at the C-terminus of the motif. It is possible that this contributes to the ability to form a polyproline helix structure observed in the bound state. Both characterised MxPP-like motif instances contain large stretches of prolines at their C-termini suggesting the structural properties of the C-terminus can compensate for the weak methionine in the hydrophobic position. Overall, the enthalpic specificity determinullts are quite poor. In the structure of the FxxP motif bound to the EVH1 domain, only two residues are significantly buried in the binding pocket. This would point to a large structural component in the binding of the peptides. The C-terminal proline preference and the polyproline helix formed when bound are in agreement with this possibility. Finally, phosphorylation of FxxP motifs in Cdc6 at position 5 can decrease the binding strength for PP4 from 6.7µM to 39.8µM. The mechanism of modulation is unclear as there are no clear steric or electrostatic clashes, however, the phosphorylated region does form a polyproline helix when bound so a structural conflict may drive the affinity change. At time of curation, no structures were available to gain more detailed insight for the MxPP variant motif.",

Since CSL may function as either a gene expression repressor or activator, depending on it’s conformation, it represents a key step in gene expression where several co-regulatory proteins operate. RITA and KyoT2 are such co-regulators and interact with CSL via the same binding motif as Notch, ɸWɸP (Wacker,2011; Collins,2014). Some viruses have developed mechanisms to manipulate Notch-signalling by expressing proteins that carry this binding motif and thus permanently stimulate Notch-like expression regulation (Calderwood,2011; Heinzelmann,2010).In all non-viral proteins, which carry the motif, a conserved occurrence of a G or an A at least 3 positions in front of the SLiM can be noticed. In Notch proteins, a basic region of circa five amino acids length precedes the hydrophobic motif, separated by a gap of about five residues. The basic residues also bind to CSL. The viral proteins, which tend to manipulate Notch-controlled gene-expression, do not show these extra residues, having just the core WxP-based motif. Often the viral proteins have multiple WxP motifs, some of which do not match the ELM pattern, having a non-hydrophobic residue in the less conserved positions. It is likely that the viral motifs can bind multiple CSL molecules.",

                "Calmodulin (CaM) is a calcium-dependent regulatory protein known to interact with as many as 320 target proteins. It serves as a primary receptor of intracellular Ca²+ capable of responding to wide range of calcium concentration and translates the Ca²+-signal into a cellular process. CaM is composed of two homologous domains, the N- and C-terminal domains (also called N-lobe and C-lobe), capable of independently folding, connected by a flexible linker. Each domain of CaM contains two helix-loop-helix Ca²+-binding motifs. Upon binding of four Ca²+-ions through these motifs, CaM changes its conformation from a closed form to an open one, exposing a hydrophobic surface capable of interacting with different target proteins. The structural plasticity of CaM allows it to bind different targets with different structural features like protein kinases, phosphatases, receptors, ion-channel proteins, phosphodiesterases, and nitric oxide synthases. The Ca²+-dependent CaM binding site often consists of a basic amphipathic",
                "The IQ motif occurs in myosins and non-myosins proteins and is generally widely distributed in nature. It is sequence with the general consensus [I,L,V]QxxxRGxxx[R,K] with characteristic residues being a hydrophobic residue at position 1, a highly conserved glutamine at position 2, basic charges at positions 6 and 11, and a variable glycine at position 7. Structural studies show that the IQ motif adopts a α-helical conformation, with distinct to no amphipathicity and a net positive charge. The IQ motif enables the Ca2+-independent binding of CaM to target proteins. In some cases (e.g. glycogen phosphorylse b kinase and nitric oxide synthase), the presence of Ca2+ has no effect on CaM-binding, in other cases such as neuromodulin the presence of Ca2+ disables the binding event. The fact that the IQ motif is highly hydrophobic and basic in nature, similar to other Ca2+-CaM binding motifs (LIG_CaM_1-(5-10)-14, LIG_CaM_1-(8)-14 etc.) results in the fact that many IQ motifs can interact with both apo- and Ca2+-CaM. The motif often occurs as multiple tandem repeats in myosins and in some non-myosins proteins. It is sometimes the target of phosphorylation by PKC or PKA proteins. Proteins found to contain at least one IQ domain include myosins, voltage-operated channels, several neuronal growth proteins, phosphatases, sperm surface proteins, Ras exchange proteins, spindle-associated proteins, a RasGAP-like protein and several plant-specific proteins.",

                "Factor XI (FXI) acts in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, it is the zymogen of FXIa, which cleaves Factor IX (FIX). FXI is a disulfide-linked dimer of two subunits, each harbouring four apple domains (A1-4) and a C-terminal trypsin-like catalytic domain. The apple domains assemble into a saucer-shaped disc, where A4 provides the dimerization interface, and the two A2 domains are separated furthest from each other in the FXI dimer. A close homolog of FXI, plasma coagulation factor prekallikrein (PK) has the same domain structure but is a monomeric protein. No other proteins with a similar domain arrangement have been described. Both FXI and PK circulate in complex with a nonenzymatic cofactor, high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK). HK and extracellular matrix components laminin and collagen V employ similar DFP motifs to bind to the 2nd apple domain of FXI and PK.",
                "The DFP tripeptide motif was derived from a dedicated random peptide-binding screen for coagulation factor XI (FXI) binding. Also, a hydrophobic, aromatic or histidine side chain (F/Y/I/W/H) is preferred two positions ahead of the DFP (Wong,2016). The [FYHWI].DF[PD] motif is only found in a restricted number of extracellular human proteins, including high-molecular weight kininogen (HK), laminin and collagen V (Wong,2016). Of these, HK was already known to act as a cofactor for FXI and to bind the 2nd apple domain (A2; or PAN domain; PFAM: PF00024) of coagulation factor XI (FXI) and plasma kallikrein heavy chain (Tait,1987; Renne,2002; Renne,2002). Surface plasmon resonullce (SPR) studies confirmed that full-length heterotrimeric laminin-111, -411, -511 and the DFP motif detected within collagen V specifically bind to FXI (Wong,2016), thus the DFP motif is used by both the cofactor HK and extracellular matrix proteins to interact with FXI and PK.Structures available for this domain-motif interaction showcase three peptide sequences, one from HK (5I25), one from laminin (5EOD) and one from the random peptide screen (5EOK). The three peptides occupy the same elongated crevice of the 2nd apple domain of FXI and PK. The DFP phenylalanine side chain fits precisely into a major pocket of the domain with the proline and aspartate sidechains also forming contacts. A second interaction is mediated by the residue 2 residues ahead of the core DFP sequence contacting a minor pocket of the apple domain (Wong,2016).The [FYWHIL].DF[PD] motif pattern is of relatively high confidence and also well represents the results of the peptide screen (it covers 41 of the detected 52 peptides).",
